Run `:PantheonOpen`, `:PantheonClose`, or `:PantheonToggle`.

Inside Pantheon:

- `i`, `k`, `j`, and `l` move up, down, left/back, and right/select.
- `<Left>` goes back and `<Right>` selects or opens the highlighted item.
- `f` opens the activity-type checklist for the selected contributor.
- `F` opens the global activity-type checklist.
- In a checklist, `<Space>`, `l`, or `<CR>` toggles a checkbox; `a` enables all and `n` disables all.
- `<CR>` selects a contributor or opens an activity item.
- `o` opens the selected profile or activity item in your browser.
- `r` bypasses the five-minute cache and refreshes activity.
- `b` returns to the contributor list.
- `q`, `<C-c>`, or `<Esc>` closes the window.

Pantheon uses GitHub's public events API. It works without authentication and
uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` automatically when that environment variable is present.
You may instead pass `token` to `setup`, though environment variables are safer
than storing credentials in your Neovim configuration.

GitHub public events are not real-time and can be delayed. Only public activity
is shown.

GitHub no longer includes commit metadata in push events. Pantheon enriches up
to `push_detail_limit` pushes with cached compare requests so push items show a
commit count and latest commit message. A `GITHUB_TOKEN` is recommended if you
preview many contributors because unauthenticated API limits are lower.

## Activity filters

Use GitHub event type names to choose which activity Pantheon reports. A global
allowlist applies to everyone, and a username-specific allowlist overrides it:

```lua
require("pantheon").setup({
  activity_types = {
    "PushEvent",
    "PullRequestEvent",
    "IssuesEvent",
    "ReleaseEvent",
  },
  user_activity_types = {
    mitchellh = { "PushEvent", "ReleaseEvent" },
    dtolnay = { "PushEvent", "PullRequestEvent" },
  },
})
```

Omit `activity_types` to show every event type. Set either allowlist to `{}` to
show no activity in that scope. Filters affect the initial preview and full
activity window.

Checkbox changes are saved to `stdpath("state")/pantheon.json` and restored on
the next `setup()` call. Set `persist_filters = false` to keep changes for the
current session only, or set `state_file` to use another location.

Common values are `PushEvent`, `PullRequestEvent`, `PullRequestReviewEvent`,
`PullRequestReviewCommentEvent`, `IssuesEvent`, `IssueCommentEvent`,
`CommitCommentEvent`, `CreateEvent`, `DeleteEvent`, `ForkEvent`, `WatchEvent`,
`ReleaseEvent`, `GollumEvent`, `MemberEvent`, and `PublicEvent`.

## Browser

On Windows, Pantheon opens links directly in a new normal Edge window. It does
not use a separate browser profile. On other systems it uses Neovim's standard
system-browser handler. To choose a browser explicitly, provide its executable
and arguments; Pantheon appends the URL:

```lua
require("pantheon").setup({
  browser_command = {
    "C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft/Edge/Application/msedge.exe",
    "--new-window",
  },
})
```
